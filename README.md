#  Kodio

## A macOS Ventura music remote for [Kodi](https://kodi.tv)

**Kodio** is written in SwiftUI 4 for macOS Ventura. Kodi version 19 *Matrix* is required.

Unlike most SwiftUI programmers, my focus is on macOS. It is a challenge because there is *by far* less information about SwiftUI on macOS. Well, part of the fun.

There are plenty Kodi music remotes for iOS and iPadOS. The _official Kodi Remote for iOS_ (in the AppStore) works very well and [KODI Music Remote](https://kodimusicremote.com/) is simply great!

For macOS, there is none, except mine. I think it is also a little bit great, haha!


### Bugs, bugs, bugs!

Yes, I know. **Kodio** is a bit buggy and always will be. Learning everyday something new and **Kodio** will always be work in progress. Part of the hobby! It is not my job. Not even close; I'm actually a seaman with a lot of free time, haha!

## Dependencies

**Kodio** depends on the following Swift Package that is also in my GitHub account:

- [SwiftlyKodiAPI](https://github.com/Desbeers/swiftlykodiapi/). The Swift API to talk to Kodio.

## Code documentation

The source code of **Kodio** is well [documented](https://desbeers.github.io/Kodio/).

## How to compile

1. Clone the project.
2. Change the signing certificate to your own.
2. Build and run!
