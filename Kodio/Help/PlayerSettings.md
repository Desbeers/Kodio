# Player Settings

Kodi can alter your 'Volume settings' and 'Crossfade settings' in your Kodi host if you want.

Kodio will not do this by default because it will not change any setting in your Kodi by itself.

You can enable this feature in the `Settings`.

## ReplayGain

Well, as a *real* lover of my own library, my music is tagged with ReplayGain

> [ReplayGain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReplayGain) is a proposed technical standard published by David Robinson in 2001 to measure and normalise the perceived loudness of audio in computer audio formats such as MP3 and Ogg Vorbis. It allows media players to normalise loudness for individual tracks or albums. This avoids the common problem of having to manually adjust volume levels between tracks when playing audio files from albums that have been mastered at different loudness levels.

### Settings Kodio can change on start of playback:

- When you start an album, Kodi's 'Volume adjustment' setting wil be set to 'Use album levels' and Crossfade will always be disabled
- When you play a list of songs that is *not* an album, Kodio will set Kodi's ReplayGain setting to 'Use track levels'.

If you play a single track, playlist or  _Party Shuffle_, you can enable or disable Crossfade for each item in the `Settings`.
