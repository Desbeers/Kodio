## Filosofy

Kodio is just about your music. It does not have a 'stop' button. You will never stop listening to your music; you will just pause it or start playing a another song.

## Usage

Well, I think it is pretty straightforward. Maybe there is only one thing unusual; your library lists are `toggle buttons`. Select an artist or deselect it again. I like that. Same for genres and albums.

Start to *play* or *shuffle* your songs with the buttons above the songlist.

If you '_right click_' on a song, or open the menu on the right,  you can play it. If it is already in the queue, it will just jump to that song. If not, the queue will be emptied and the selected song will be played.

There is no option to add a new song to the `queue`. See below about settings...

## Playlists

Your Kodi playlists are loaded when Kodio is started. If you *add* or *delete* playlists; Kodio will not know until you either restart it or reload the library.

Kodio is smart enough to get *the latest and greatest* for a playlist when you selected it in the sidebar. It will update 'smart playlists' when needed.


## I cannot connect to my host!

See <doc:KodiSettings> for some tips.

## Settings and options

There are not many settings or options in *Kodio*. It just plays the music the way I like it. The _queue_ is the _queue_ and if you want to play something else; just start it.

You can't go _forward_ or _backward_ in a song. I don't see the use of it.

## Will this ever be in the Apple Store?

I don't think so. See above; I wrote this application just for fun and for my own use. I share it because I think thats a fair thing to do. Thanks to *sharing* I was able to write this. I want to give something back. The charm of *Open Source*.

Publishing an application gives responsibility. I don't want that. Also, I don't have a Developer Account, cheap as I am. Kodio expires on my iPad after a few days but I don't really care because I'm primarily a macOS user

## Bugs, bugs, bugs!

## Details are important

I want to write a beautiful application. It should behave just like you would expect. It supports *Dark Mode*, *System Settings* and will adapt to the *accent colours* you prefer.

Those are important details for me.

The rotating LP you see sometimes in the background is turning at a perfect 33 1/3... Details!
