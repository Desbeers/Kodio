# Bugs, bugs, bugs!

I know, Kodio is not perfect

Kodio is a bit buggy and always will be. Learning everyday something new and Kodio will always be work in progress. Part of the hobby! It is not my job. Not even close; I'm actually a seaman with a lot of free time, haha!

Please report them at [Github Kodio issues](https://github.com/Desbeers/Kodio/issues).
