# ReplayGain

Well, as a *real* lover of my own library, my music is tagged with ReplayGain

> [ReplayGain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReplayGain) is a proposed technical standard published by David Robinson in 2001 to measure and normalize the perceived loudness of audio in computer audio formats such as MP3 and Ogg Vorbis. It allows media players to normalize loudness for individual tracks or albums. This avoids the common problem of having to manually adjust volume levels between tracks when playing audio files from albums that have been mastered at different loudness levels.

## Kodio can alter your ReplayGain settings if you want

- When you start an album, Kodi's ReplayGain setting wil be set to 'Album'.

- When you play a list of songs that is *not* an album, Kodio will set Kodi's ReplayGain setting to 'songs'.

Kodio will not do this by default because it will not change any setting in your Kodi by itself.

You can enable this feature in the `Settings`.
